# Day 27 — JUnit, Mockito, MockMvc

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this day you will understand:

- Unit vs integration tests
- JUnit 5 @Test
- Mockito when/verify
- MockMvc for controllers
- What to mock and what not to

---

# 1. Concept

| Test | How | Mock |
|---|---|---|
| Unit service | `new DiscountService()` | none or collaborators |
| Controller slice | `@WebMvcTest` | `@MockitoBean` services |
| Integration | `@SpringBootTest` | none / testcontainers |

**Don’t mock the class under test.** Mock **dependencies**.

Don’t write MockMvc for every getter if the service test already covers the rule — but do test HTTP mappings and validation.

`@MockBean` was renamed thinking in Boot 3.4: prefer `org.springframework.test.context.bean.override.mockito.MockitoBean`. If your version still has `@MockBean`, it works.

```bash
./mvnw test
```


---

# Write this on your machine (file by file)

Do **not** copy-paste the whole answer-key folder. Create each file on your laptop, in order.

Suggested folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/springboot-practice/day-27
cd ~/springboot-practice/day-27
```

Answer key: `java-springboot-backend/practical/day-27/`

starter-test is already in the parent. Put tests in src/test/java **same package**.

| # | File | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `DiscountService.java` | pure logic |
| 2 | `DiscountServiceTest.java` | unit |
| 3 | `DiscountController.java` | HTTP |
| 4 | `DiscountControllerTest.java` | MockMvc |

```bash
mvn test
```

If MockitoBean import fails on older Boot, replace with @MockBean from org.springframework.boot.test.mock.mockito.

# Common Mistakes

1. Testing only through the UI.
2. Mocking the service under test.
3. @SpringBootTest for every unit (slow).
4. Ignoring assertions, only printing.
5. Not testing 400 validation.

---

# Practical Exercise

1. Run mvn test.
2. Add a test for non-VIP.
3. Break apply(); watch test fail.
4. Add MockMvc 400 case.
5. Explain slice vs full context.

---

# Mini Project

Test a repository with @DataJpaTest (needs JPA) OR extra MockMvc for missing param.
