# Day 16 — JPA relationships: 1-1, 1-N, N-N

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this day you will understand:

- @OneToOne User↔Profile
- @OneToMany / @ManyToOne User↔Orders
- @ManyToMany Student↔Course and join table
- owning side, mappedBy, @JoinColumn
- Why returning entities causes infinite JSON — DTOs fix it
- LAZY vs EAGER

---

# 1. Concept — associations

## What is it?

How tables point at each other, expressed as Java fields.

| Relation | Example | FK lives on |
|---|---|---|
| OneToOne | User–Profile | profiles.user_id (owning) |
| OneToMany | User–Orders | orders.user_id |
| ManyToOne | Order–User | same |
| ManyToMany | Student–Course | join table student_course |

## Owning vs inverse

The **owning side** has the FK (`@JoinColumn`). The inverse has `mappedBy`. You **must set the owning side** in Java (`order.setUser(user)`). Helper methods `addOrder` keep both sides in sync.

## Infinite JSON

If a controller returns `User` with `orders` and each `Order` has `user`, Jackson recurses until the stack explodes. **DTOs flatten the graph.** Never `@JsonIgnore` as your only strategy.

## LAZY vs EAGER

Default: ManyToOne EAGER (historical), OneToMany LAZY. Prefer **LAZY everywhere** and fetch what you need (Day 17). Accessing a lazy field outside a transaction → `LazyInitializationException`.

# Write this on your machine (file by file)

Do **not** copy-paste the whole answer-key folder. Create each file on your laptop, in order.

Suggested folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/springboot-practice/day-16
cd ~/springboot-practice/day-16
```

Answer key: `java-springboot-backend/practical/day-16/`

Same MySQL. Package `com.course.day16`. Seed runner creates Ada + profile + order.

| # | File | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `User.java` | OneToOne + OneToMany |
| 2 | `Profile.java` | owning OneToOne |
| 3 | `Order.java` | ManyToOne LAZY |
| 4 | `Student/Course` | ManyToMany join table |
| 5 | `RelationSeed.java` | how to set both sides |

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
# inspect tables: users, profiles, orders, student_course
```

Do **not** add a REST controller that returns User. If you want HTTP, return a DTO without nested back-references.

# Common Mistakes

1. **mappedBy on both sides.**
2. **Forgetting to set the owning side.**
3. **EAGER OneToMany** loading the universe.
4. **Returning entities from REST.**
5. **CascadeType.ALL from Order to User** (wrong direction).

---

# Practical Exercise

1. Run seed; SELECT join users/profiles/orders.
2. Draw owning vs inverse.
3. Add a second order via addOrder.
4. Explain LazyInitializationException.
5. Sketch a UserResponse without orders cycle.

# Mini Project

Add Category–Product ManyToOne. Product owns category_id.
