# Day 24 — Spring Security fundamentals

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this day you will understand:

- Authentication vs authorization
- SecurityFilterChain
- Password hashing (BCrypt)
- Roles vs authorities
- Why CSRF is disabled for stateless APIs (carefully)

---

# 1. Concept

## Authentication

Who are you? (login, basic auth, JWT)

## Authorization

What may you do? (roles)

## Filter chain

Servlet filters wrap every request **before** the controller. Spring Security’s `SecurityFilterChain` is a bean you configure in Boot 3 (the old `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` is **gone**).

```text
Request → Security filters → DispatcherServlet → Controller
```

## Password hashing

Never store raw passwords. `BCryptPasswordEncoder` hashes with salt. `{noop}password` is for demos only — not today.

## HTTP Basic (today)

```bash
curl -u ada:password http://localhost:8080/api/private/me
```

JWT is tomorrow. Today you feel the filter chain.

## CSRF

Browser cookie sessions need CSRF tokens. **Stateless Bearer JWT APIs** typically disable CSRF. Don’t disable CSRF if you use cookie sessions.

# Write this on your machine (file by file)

Do **not** copy-paste the whole answer-key folder. Create each file on your laptop, in order.

Suggested folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/springboot-practice/day-24
cd ~/springboot-practice/day-24
```

Answer key: `java-springboot-backend/practical/day-24/`

starter-security. Without SecurityFilterChain, Boot’s default requires auth on every URL with a random password in logs.

| # | File | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `SecurityConfig.java` | filter chain + BCrypt + in-memory user |
| 2 | `DemoController.java` | public vs private |

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/public/ping
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/private/me
curl -u ada:password http://localhost:8080/api/private/me
```

Public ping is 200 without credentials. Private me is 401 then 200 with -u.

# Common Mistakes

1. Leaving default generated password.
2. Storing plain passwords.
3. csrf.disable on a cookie session app.
4. WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter tutorials (Boot 2).
5. permitAll on /api/** by accident.

---

# Practical Exercise

1. Hit public and private.
2. Wrong password 401.
3. Change role to ADMIN and require it (preview Day 26).
4. Read filter chain log.
5. Encode a password in main with BCrypt.

# Mini Project

Add /api/public/health returning UP.

- BCrypt.
- permitAll vs authenticated.
- CSRF vs stateless.
- Security 6 API.

---

# What You Should Be Able To Explain

- AuthN vs AuthZ
- SecurityFilterChain
