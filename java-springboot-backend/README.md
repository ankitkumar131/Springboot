# 30-Day Java + Spring Boot Backend Mastery Course

A complete, self-study course that takes you from **zero Spring Boot knowledge** to a **production-oriented Java backend developer**.

You already know Java. This course does **not** reteach Java from scratch. It teaches the Java you actually use in Spring Boot, then builds Spring, Spring Boot, REST APIs, databases, security, testing, and production practices — one day at a time.

## What this course teaches

After 30 days you will be able to:

- Create Spring Boot applications from Spring Initializr
- Explain IoC, dependency injection, beans, and the Spring container
- Build REST APIs with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Design controller / service / repository layers
- Use request/response DTOs instead of exposing entities
- Validate requests and return standardized error responses
- Connect **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MongoDB**
- Use Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, JPQL, pagination, sorting, and relationships
- Implement JWT authentication and role-based authorization
- Write unit and integration tests with JUnit, Mockito, and MockMvc
- Document APIs with OpenAPI / Swagger UI
- Use Actuator, logging, profiles, and Flyway
- Containerize a backend with Docker Compose
- Explain your project in a backend interview

**Stack used throughout this course**

| Tool | Version / notes |
|---|---|
| Java | 21 LTS (minimum 17) |
| Spring Boot | 3.4.x (Jakarta namespace, Spring Security 6) |
| Build | Maven |
| Relational DBs | MySQL 8, PostgreSQL 16 |
| Document DB | MongoDB 7 |
| Testing | JUnit 5, Mockito, MockMvc, Spring Boot Test |
| Docs | springdoc-openapi |
| Containers | Docker + Docker Compose |

Spring Boot 3.x is the production standard most interviewers still expect. Spring Boot 4.x exists; APIs in this course stay on the 3.4 line so examples compile against the ecosystem you will actually join. Differences are called out where they matter.

## Prerequisites

You should already be comfortable with:

- Java syntax, classes, methods, and basic OOP
- Compiling and running a Java program
- Using an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code)
- Basic command-line usage

You do **not** need:

- Spring or Spring Boot
- Dependency injection knowledge
- REST / HTTP expertise
- JPA, Hibernate, or any database experience
- Docker, JWT, or testing frameworks

If Java is rusty, Days 1–2 are a targeted refresher aimed at Spring Boot — not a beginner Java textbook.

Full details: [00-roadmap/prerequisites.md](00-roadmap/prerequisites.md)

---

## Required software

Install these before Day 5 (project creation). Day 1–4 can be followed with Java + an IDE only.

| Software | Why |
|---|---|
| JDK 21 | Compile and run the course apps |
| Maven 3.9+ (or Maven Wrapper) | Build tool |
| IntelliJ IDEA Community or VS Code | Editor |
| Postman (or curl) | Call APIs |
| Git | Version control |
| MySQL 8 | Days 13–17 |
| PostgreSQL 16 | Days 18–20 |
| MongoDB 7 + Compass | Days 21–23 |
| Docker Desktop | Day 29 |

Step-by-step install, verification commands, and common failures: [00-roadmap/setup-guide.md](00-roadmap/setup-guide.md)

---

## How to use this course

1. Open **one day folder**. Start with [`day-01-java-for-springboot/README.md`](day-01-java-for-springboot/README.md).
2. Read the theory. Type the code yourself — do not copy-paste blindly.
3. Complete the **Practical Exercise** and **Mini Project**.
4. Answer the **Interview Questions** out loud before reading the answers.
5. Do the **Day-End Practice** tasks.
6. Tick the checklist below.
7. Move to the next day. Do not skip Days 3–4 (IoC/DI). Everything else sits on them.

**Recommended daily workload**

```text
1–2 hours theory
2–3 hours coding
1 hour exercises
30–60 minutes interview preparation
```

Every day follows the same shape:

```text
Theory → Example → Code → Hands-on exercise → Mini project → Interview questions → Revision
```

## Projects

Theory without code does not stick. You will build these:

| Project | Stack | Folder |
|---|---|---|
| 1. User Management CRUD API | In-memory → MySQL, validation, exceptions | [projects/project-01-crud-api](projects/project-01-crud-api) |
| 2. Product Management API | MySQL, JPA, DTO, pagination, filter, sort | [projects/project-02-product-api](projects/project-02-product-api) |
| 3. Authentication API | Register, login, JWT, roles | [projects/project-03-authentication-api](projects/project-03-authentication-api) |
| 4. Blog API | MongoDB, posts, authors, comments, search | [projects/project-04-mongodb-blog-api](projects/project-04-mongodb-blog-api) |
| 5. Employee Management | PostgreSQL, JPA, JWT, pagination | [projects/project-05-postgresql-employee-api](projects/project-05-postgresql-employee-api) |
| Capstone | E-Commerce backend (users, products, cart, orders) | [projects/final-project](projects/final-project) |

Each project folder contains **complete, copy-ready Java example code**, `pom.xml`, configuration, and HTTP examples.

---

## Practical code (type this on your machine)

Every lesson has a matching runnable folder:

```text
java-springboot-backend/practical/day-01
java-springboot-backend/practical/day-02
...
java-springboot-backend/practical/day-30
```

**How to study each day**

1. Open that day's `README.md` and read the theory.
2. Follow **Write this on your machine (file by file)** — create each file locally yourself.
3. When you get stuck, compare with `practical/day-XX/` (the finished reference).
4. Do not copy-paste the whole folder first. Typing is the point.

Suggested local workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/springboot-practice
cd ~/springboot-practice
```

Create `day-01`, `day-02`, … there as the lesson instructs. The `practical/` folder in this repo is the answer key, not a substitute for writing the files.

---

## Databases

This course covers all three. None of them is “best”.

| Database | Use in this course |
|---|---|
| MySQL | First relational backend, User + Product APIs |
| PostgreSQL | UUID, JSONB, Employee API, capstone relational data |
| MongoDB | Blog API, optional product reviews in the capstone |

Comparison is taught on Day 23 and in [cheatsheets](cheatsheets).

---

## Interview preparation

Every day includes **15 interview questions** (5 Easy, 5 Medium, 5 Hard) with answers, examples, tips, and follow-ups.

Dedicated files in [`interview/`](interview):

- Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Spring MVC
- REST APIs, JPA, Hibernate
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Spring Security, JWT, Testing, Docker
- Backend architecture + coding questions

Cheat sheets in [`cheatsheets/`](cheatsheets):

- Annotations, REST, JPA, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, debugging

---

## Expected outcome

By Day 30 you should be able to sit in a backend interview and:

1. Draw the request flow from HTTP → Controller → Service → Repository → Database.
2. Explain why constructor injection and DTOs exist.
3. Walk through a JWT login on a whiteboard.
4. Diagnose `LazyInitializationException` and N+1 queries.
5. Describe a real project (the capstone) with trade-offs.

That is the bar this course is written against.
