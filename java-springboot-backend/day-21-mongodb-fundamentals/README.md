# Day 21 — MongoDB and documents from zero

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this day you will understand:

- NoSQL vs relational
- database, collection, document, BSON, ObjectId
- embed vs reference
- when Mongo vs SQL
- connection URI

---

# 1. Concept — document database

MongoDB stores **BSON documents** in **collections**. No fixed schema required (you should still design one).

```json
{ "_id": "ObjectId(...)", "title": "Hello", "tags": ["java", "mongo"], "author": { "name": "Ada" } }
```

## Vocabulary

| Mongo | Rough SQL analog |
|---|---|
| database | database |
| collection | table |
| document | row (but nested) |
| field | column |
| ObjectId | surrogate key |

## Embed vs reference

- **Embed** comments inside a post if you always load them together and they don’t explode in size.
- **Reference** (`authorId`) if you would duplicate a large author or many-to-many.

## When Mongo

Flexible shape, hierarchical data, high write volume of similar docs (reviews, logs).

## When not

Heavy multi-row transactions/joins as the core of the domain (orders+inventory+payments) — Postgres/MySQL.

```properties
spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/app_db
```

# Write this on your machine (file by file)

Do **not** copy-paste the whole answer-key folder. Create each file on your laptop, in order.

Suggested folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/springboot-practice/day-21
cd ~/springboot-practice/day-21
```

Answer key: `java-springboot-backend/practical/day-21/`

Docker mongo:7. mongosh. No Java required today.

| # | File | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `sample.js` | insert/find in mongosh |

```bash
mongosh app_db sample.js
```

Type the JS into mongosh line by line if you prefer.

---

# Common Mistakes

1. Treating Mongo as schema-less chaos.
2. Embedding unbounded arrays.
3. Using Mongo because it's trendy for orders+payments.
4. Forgetting _id is ObjectId not Long.
5. Connection refused 27017.

---

# Practical Exercise

1. insertOne a post.
2. find by tag.
3. update a nested field.
4. Draw embed vs ref.
5. Explain BSON.

# Mini Project

Model a blog post with embedded comments (max a few dozen).
