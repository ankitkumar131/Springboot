# Day 15 — User Management API on MySQL + JPA

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this day you will understand:

- Replace the in-memory Map with JpaRepository
- Keep the same /api/users URLs as Days 9–12
- Use DTOs + @Valid + global errors against a real table
- @Transactional on service methods
- Prove data survives restart

---

# 1. Concept — same API, real database

## What is it?

The User Management API from memory, now on MySQL.

## Why?

Restart the process: users are still there. Two Postman creates = two rows you can `SELECT`.

## Real-world analogy

The receptionist script (HTTP) did not change. The filing cabinet replaced the whiteboard.

## Flow

```text
HTTP → Controller → Service (@Transactional) → JpaRepository → Hibernate → MySQL
```

---

# 2. @Transactional

On `create/update/delete`: one unit of work. On read methods: `readOnly = true` (hint).

If you `new UserService` yourself, **there is no proxy** — transactions won’t start (Day 4).

---

# 3. Write on your machine

Start MySQL (`app_db`). Type every class. Run POST then `SELECT * FROM users;`.


---

# Write this on your machine (file by file)

Do **not** copy-paste the whole answer-key folder. Create each file on your laptop, in order.

Suggested folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/springboot-practice/day-15
cd ~/springboot-practice/day-15
```

Answer key: `java-springboot-backend/practical/day-15/`

Package `com.course.day15`. pom: web + validation + jpa + mysql.

| # | File | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `User.java` | @Entity |
| 2 | `UserRequest/Response` | DTOs |
| 3 | `UserRepository.java` | JpaRepository |
| 4 | `UserService.java` | @Transactional |
| 5 | `UserController.java` | HTTP |
| 6 | `exceptions + advice` | 404/409 |

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/users -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Ada","email":"ada@example.com"}'
```

Restart the app and GET `/api/users` — Ada must still exist. That is the victory condition for Day 15.

---

# Common Mistakes

1. **Returning Entity from the controller.**
2. **Forgetting unique email until MySQL error.**
3. **ddl-auto=create-drop** wiping data.
4. **Calling repository from controller.**
5. **No MySQL running** and blaming JPA.

---

# Practical Exercise

1. Create, get, list, update, delete via Postman.
2. Duplicate email 409.
3. Restart persistence check.
4. Watch SQL logs.
5. GET missing → 404 JSON.

---

# Mini Project

Add GET `/api/users/by-email?email=` using `findByEmail` on the repository.
